### Working in Ireland for Software Engineering Professionals

#### Little something about me
1. Am a Software Engineer with some years of experience.
2. Worked in Software Consulting Services, Product Engineering, Tools Engineering, Cloud Platform Engineering...
3. Am not from Ireland, heck am not even from EU.
4. Have lived and worked in Ireland for a few years.
5. Have been through the job hunt process a few times over the years and have my fair share of experience in Ireland.
6. Am a backend guy for most part, so my views are from that perspective.

What I have here is a collection of experiences, advice, rants and random thoughts which I feel will be give interesting insights to people. Also I am not going to lie, but it is also to try out Github pages and store this collection from my mind in case I get hit by a car and forget everything.

When I think about it, these also apply in most countries in a general sense. Certain specifics vary.
