Congratulations on starting your new job. You are both anxious and excited at the same time, thinking about what lies ahead. Here are some things I have learned from my experiences.


## Work Stuff

1. Communication: I cannot stress how important this is. It's not humanly possible to know and be an expert on everything in the tech & project stack. But good communication can help in clarity of expectations/requirements, failing early & often, asking for help, bouncing off ideas, feedback and getting quality work done.
2. There is always a balance between feature development vs bug fix vs tackling technical debt.
3. Do not completely fill your plate from the start. You will be surprised how much of the work is not foreseen beforehand. I say a healthy 70% load is good.
4. Under-promise & over-deliver is preferred over Over-promise and under-deliver.
5. 80% of the work takes 20% of the time and the remaining 20% takes 80% of time.
6. Be aware of what other members in the team are working on. It helps knowing who to ask for what things.
7. Build connections cross team & cross orgs.
8. Do not trust the latest versions. Always use the stable/LTS version for production.
9. All Pull Requests/Merge Requests should contains its own tests and descriptions.
10. Do NOT say 70% of the work is done and 30% is left when talking about status updates. Say in Progress or Complete. How do you even measure the percentage? 
11. Quality over Quantity of work.
12. Get things to completion.
13. **Do NOT write ugly code.**

## Social Stuff

1. Bias: Be cognizant of the fact people have biases and you have too. You should always acknowledge and actively work on it.
    1. Positive Bias or Preferential Treatment: Like I prefer x because he/she is from Z community. 
    2. Negative Bias or Discrimination: Like I don't like x because he/she is from Z community.
    3. Focus on what is common than focussing on what is different. After all both of you are playing for the same team.
    4. Judge people less & if you cannot help be objective. 
    5. Most multi nationals are global with people from every region. Actively work on fighting biases due historical or political factors involving people from different places. 
2. Networking: Actively network with people outside your immediate team and org. You will be surprised how useful it can be.
3. Personal Space (mostly for folks from non EU): Especially in office every co-worker has a personal area. People might not like if you just walk up to them and start chatting.
4. Privacy (mostly for folks from non EU): Fiendly & Friends are two different things. It is not nice to ask personal questions to someone whom you have only chatted to once or twice. Even though their friendly attitude gives you the impression of knowing them for many years. Be respectful of people's privacy & private information.
5. Asthetics: Dress Nice, Maintain High Standards of Hygiene, Good posture
6. Pints: Social life in Dublin revolves around beer (alcohol) especially going to pubs after work for a few pints. It is nice to accompany the team to a pub for a few pints. You can get non alcoholic beers or mocktails if you don't drink. Getting to know your teammates outside work. It can be pretty fun. Also no work talk in the pub.
7. Your working hours is usually 7-9 hours in a day. Don't spend most of it in non-work related activities.
8. Generalization & Steretyping: Do NOT generalize things about people from their appearance based on what you have seen on the TV or internet. Everyone is different.
9. Visibility: Do not be timid. Share your thoughts and opinions with people freely as long as they not maligning someone. No behind the back b*tching.
10. Aware of social issues: Be aware of social issues in the world like discrimination against LGBTQ+, inequality, veganism & greenhouse emissions, etc.
