## Why companies choose Ireland?

1. Low corporate taxes.
2. The only officially english speaking country in European Union.
3. Member of European Union
    1. Access to EU Consumers (GDPR advantage).
    2. Access to EEA + UK workforce (no visa/work permit needed).
4. Timezone between US West Coast and Asia.
5. Cheaper work force than US West Coast (almost half).
6. Stable society and government.
7. Even more tax breaks for companies if they employ at least 200 people in Ireland. (Low corp taxes is compensated with high income taxes)

## Visa Stuffs

1. Work Authorization
    1. EU/EEA + UK: If you hold a passport from this region, you don't need permit to work.
    2. Others:
        1. Work Permit Types 
            1. Critical Skills Employment Permit (Most Engineering is in this track)
            2. General Work Permit
        2. Process:
            1. You/Your company files for a work permit.
            2. Ministry of Industries approves/grants it.
            3. If you are outside Ireland
                1. Apply for entry visa with the work permit
                2. Enter Ireland
                3. You have to complete the next step before your entry visa expires.
            4. You are in Ireland. Apply for Irish Residence Permit in Ministry of Immigration.
            5. You get your IRP with the correct Stamp number (Stamp 1 as of Aug 2022).
            6. You are good to go.

2. Positions & work permit sponsorship (rough estimates)
    1. 50% positions are EU/Stamp 4 (in some cases Stamp 1G) only
    2. 25% positions are fixed length contracts.
    3. 25% positions are full time and have visa/work permit sponsorship support (This is a most competitive group. Don't forget applicants are from Ireland, UK, EU, US, Asia, South America, Rest of the World).

**Enjoy the ride. This is the best time to be a Software Engineer!**
