Amazing! You have a greenlight from the interviewers.

### Next Steps!

1. Recruiter will set up a call to discuss initial numbers (compensation) & job level(position).
2. You get 1-2 days to think about it and come back with a yes / no / i need more.
3. If you have offers from other companies (especially if it is from a competitor) make sure to let your recruiter know.  This will give you an advantage in the negotiations.
4. Once both you and recruiter reach an agreement, wait for the recruiter to generate the "offer letter/contract".
5. You get 3-7 days to digitally accept/sign the offer letter.
6. Once you do that, congratulations!! You now have a formal job offer from a company.

### Things to keep in mind

1. Every psoition has an associated range & levels for base pay.
    1. Say you are interviewing for X level engineer for a company whose average pay for that position is 50,000. (Example, will be different in reality)
        1. Band A: 54-58K
        2. Band B: 50-54K
        3. Band C: 46-50K
        4. Band D: 42-46K 
    2. Depending on your experience, interview performance, visa sponsorship, ability to join sooner, team/org budget, urgency and hiring manager's frustration levels in getting talent, you will be placed in one of these bands. Usually B or C.
2. Do your salary research before you start negotiations or answer "what is your expectation" question.
3. There is a large variance between pays for different companies for the same experience.
    1. Very high paying companies include Finance/Trading companies, Big Tech, Well funded/Pre IPO startups.
    2. The higher the pay, the higher is the interview bar, the higher is the expectation from the engineer.
    3. Ramp up times, tolerance for mistakes, performance expectations are also reflected in the pay.
4. If the company has a bonus and/or RSU/ESOP/Commission component, managers have more flexbility in negotiating these than the base pay.
5. Always do tax calculations to understand what you will receive in your bank account.
    1. Tax bands for base pay.
    2. Benefits & Allowances are taxable.
    3. Bonus/RSUs are taxed at 52% (Aug, 2022) 
6. Include your cost of living in the calculation. Are you in Dublin or Outside? Do you have to support a family? etc



Note: Your offer may have 1 or multiple of the above as part of your package. It depends on the company.
