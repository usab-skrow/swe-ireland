Effectively searching and applying for the correct role can be hard but having a framework can help reduce waste of time and effort.

## Let's search for a job (as I would do)

### Set up job filter 

1. Position/designation: Based on **relevant** years of experience.
2. Tech stack: Do some research using the tech stack. Could be the stack you have worked with, or the stack you want to work on. Usually its a balance between the two. Like for backend is it JVM stack (Java, Scala) or GoLang stack or Ruby on Rails stack etc.
3. Search for areas to work in: Platform, Tools, Cloud, API, Distributed Systems, Mobile Apps, Frontend SPAs, Enterprise Apps etc 
4. (For non EU) Company visa support: Do you need & Does it mention something explicitly
5. (For non EU) Language requirements: Does it mention **Native** speakers of certain languages. Native means raised and optionally born in that region. It is rare but mostly found in customer engineering roles.

### LinkedIn Research

1. **Find & connect with recruiters & engineering managers in linkedin who are based in Ireland. (Search for tech recruiter & engineering manager)**
2. Search LinkedIn jobs with the company name to understand if there is a hiring spree going on.
3. Follow the company and hashtag to see if there is a lot of new hire activity.
4. Drop a message with the joblink to the recruiter if it is of interest.
5. If the company is known to hire more from referrals then **politely request** for referral from an existing employee in LinkedIn with the job link in their career site.
6. Also remember jobs in LinkedIn and in the company's career site might be out of sync. In that case, company career site is the source of truth.

### Other Platforms
1. Glassdoor
2. Indeed 

### CV
1. 1 page CV if you are applying to Senior Software Engineer & below.
2. Explicitly put **what you did** rather than what the team's responsility were.
3. If it's for technical role, make sure you add "technical description" of your work. Don't be afraid to put technical jargon in the CV. CV's are reviewed by recruiters, engineering managers & senior engineers in the team.
4. If you feel your professional experience is not too impressive due to whatever reason, supplement with a github profile of your side projects. Add them in the CV. Make sure the repos are public and can be reviewed.
5. You are telling a story in your CV. Don't make the reviewer confused by adding a bit of everything. Quality over Quantity.

### Apply
1. Apply on career site. (First preference)
2. Apply on job sites.
3. It takes some time to find the right match, so don't get discouraged if you don't hear back the next day or next week.
4. If you don't see an opening at the moment in the career site, join their talent network if its available. That way recruiters already know you are interested in the company even before a requirement is created.
