Well it's a very subjective area to be honest. Every person's definition of success is different.

## Things that could be a parameter to check professional success

1. You enjoy your work.
2. You are perfectly content in the team/company.
3. You feel you are adequately compensated for the work you do.
4. You are learning new things.
5. You feel your work has visibility and makes a difference.
6. You have the trust of your teammates and manager in taking care of something.

## Promotions

1. IC
    1. Junior > Mid > Senior is relatively straight forward and happens naturally.
    2. Staff is fewer and is only earned when you have demonstrated technical leadership qualities consistently.
    3. Principal is even rarer. A large company with 10K engineers will have less than 15-20 Principal Engineers.
2. M
    1. Manager > Senior Manager is relatively straight forward.
    2. Director & Senior Director is far fewer and requires consistent demonstration of management aptitude and managing large teams & projects.
    3. VP is even rarer. Remember 1 VP per Business Unit/Product Line. An engineering org will have 10-15 VPs

## Random nuggets

1. Personally I have found that observing and engaging people who are senior to me in their work helped me grow a lot technically. Understand their rationality and thought process for their work.
2. Being hands-on usually is much better when learning something new. There are many issues that are not covered in documentation which surface during implementation.
3. Somethings are earned and somethings are demanded. With experience people understand when to use what.
4. Experience matters a lot. Most of the knowledge of a lead engineer is from previous experience and very less from documenation.
5. Sometimes you just have to be in the right place at the right time. Networking increases the odds by a lot.
6. Bit corny but I read somewhere, whats luck ? Its when preparation meets opportunity. Thats luck.
7. You have to decide if you wanna do a DFS or BFS.
    1. DFS if you want to be an expert in the company's projects and see a long term future in the company for yourself. Take the plunge and dive deep.
    2. BFS if you want to work on different types of projects to increase the breadth of your knowledge. You will have to change teams and companies in this road.
8. Don't be afraid to take decisions for your career. Uncertainty of tomorrow will always be there. Don't go into the rabbit hole of what if I did/didn't do that.
9. Build relationships across team and org. You need a lot of supporters after a certain level. 
10. LayOffs are a reality in today's world. That's how companies fuel growth in down times.
11. In a group of engineers, 
    1. The bad ones don't get through or weeded out.
    2. The best ones don't need a mic to tell everyone they are the best. The work shows. Nobody messes with them.
    3. The average ones use all sorts to tricks to stand out.
    4. Try to be in the top category so you don't have to fight with other engineers, managers to demonstrate your impact/contribution.
